I am currently a PhD student in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr. Hakan Bilen. My current research interest lies in articulated object modelling. Prior to this, I received my B.Eng degree from Sun Yat-sen University(SYSU) in 2018. After that, I received my M.Sc from Université de Bourgogne(M1) and Université Grenoble Alpes(M2) in 2021.
